about=This tool is designed to perform a catchment partition based on the spatial organisation of any specified catchment characteristic. Tool returns a subdivision of the given basin into sub-basins and zones (3 types). Objective is to reduce to the streamflow orientated heterogeneity of the given input characteristic. All data specified has to cover an identical spatial extent. Please note that the ArcGIS Toolbox implementation is, due to a lack of capability to execute FORTRAN –routines, extremely slow. For large-scale applications (meso-scaling catchments) it is highly recommended to use the stand-alone python-Implementation of the ACS-algorithm! Recent updates, manual and support at github.com/HenningOp/ACS. Scientific background is given in Oppel and Schumann (2017): “A method to employ the spatial organisation of catchments into semi-distributed rainfall–runoff models”, DOI: 10.5194/hess-2017-218
